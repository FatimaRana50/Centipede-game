Centipede Game
Description
This project is a Centipede arcade game developed using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The game follows a procedural programming approach, where the player controls a shooter at the bottom of the screen and aims to destroy a centipede that moves through the game field.

Features
Procedural Programming: Built using functions and structures in C++, without object-oriented design.
Classic Gameplay: Mimics the original arcade mechanics with player shooting, centipede segmentation, and basic collision detection.
Graphics and Input Handling: Uses SFML for rendering game elements and capturing player input.
